            "The power of the Web is in its universality. <br> Access by 
            everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect." <br>
            - Tim Berners-Lee
        </p>

        <p> 
            “The one argument for accessibility that doesn’t get made nearly <br>
            often enough is how extraordinarily better it makes some people’s lives. <br>
            How many opportunities do we have to dramatically improve people’s lives just<br> 
            by doing our job a little better?”  <br>
            - Steve Krug

            "We need to make every single thing accessible to every single <br>
            person with a disability."<br>
            - Stevie Wonder <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            “When speaking of disabilities, the blind and their needs are most <br>
            often used as an example. It is deceivingly simplistic since <br>
            accessibility is something most of the population can benefit from.” <br>
            - Marcus Österberg
